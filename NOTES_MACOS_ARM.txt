## STATUS

Running in development !

limited testing shows hardware and software working

discussions on going at : https://community.polyexpression.com/t/eigend-apple-silicon-it-lives



## limitations/issues
- convolver is disabled
- minor graphics issues 
- vsts not showing in workbench- hosting untested

see below for more details 


## BUILDING

python has its path encoded... so we need to becareful which we pick up
the eigenlabs python is prefixed to /usr/local/pi/Python , for the arm build we want /System/Library/Framework/Python.framework

for a arm build
export PI_PYTHON=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
export BUILD_TARGET=arm
make




## NOTES
- Carbon is not supported on arm
- can only load arm plugins, no intel emulation is planned - just another bridge?
- no universal binary (not planned)


- min macos 10.14 (Mojave)


------


## hacked code just to get it building!



//ARMHACK

pic_resources.cpp : 561 ///HACKED - no close function... move to fopen/fclose?


//JUCE
hacked... probably should be updating to new juce which has arm support
