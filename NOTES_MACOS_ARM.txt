## STATUS
not even close to working ;) 

many things building on mac mini 1, some plugins disabled see hacks at bottom
need the pico decoder to continue which I need to build 





## BUILDING

python has its path encoded... so we need to becareful which we pick up
the eigenlabs python is prefixed to /usr/local/pi/Python , for the arm build we want /System/Library/Framework/Python.framework

for a arm build
export PI_PYTHON=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python
export BUILD_TARGET=arm
make




## NOTES
- Python , EigenD runtime, ships with only 32bit Python (2.7.10), Im using the one on the M1 which is 2.7.16 - we dont know if compatible!
also Ive not looked for site packages yet... main concern is wx-python?

- Carbon is not supported on arm

- can only load arm plugins, no intel emulation is planned - just another bridge?


## TODO
we can't do a universal build, since most of eigenD is store in /usr/local/pi... 
so to allow both to exist we would need separate directories for 64 and 32 build, and now arm build!
need to consider if this is worth the 'overhead' since most users will use 32bit or 64bit intel or arm

.... its possible intel is useful under rosetta but this needs testing due to the python implications



## hacked code just to get it building!



//ARMHACK

pic_resources.cpp : 561 ///HACKED - no close function... move to fopen/fclose?


//JUCE

hacked... probably should be updating to new juce which has arm support
